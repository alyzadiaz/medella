                <p id="summary">Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. Symptoms start 
                gradually, sometimes starting with a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand. Tremors are common, but the disorder 
                also commonly causes stiffness or slowing of movement. In the early stages of Parkinson's disease, your face may show 
                little or no expression. Your arms may not swing when you walk. Your speech may become soft or slurred. Parkinson's
                 disease symptoms worsen as your condition progresses over time. Although Parkinson's disease can't be cured, medications 
                 might significantly improve your symptoms. Occasionally, your doctor may suggest surgery to regulate certain regions of 
                 your brain and improve your symptoms.

                <p>Parkinson's disease signs and symptoms can be different for everyone. Early signs may be mild and go unnoticed. 
                Symptoms often begin on one side of your body and usually remain worse on that side, even after symptoms begin to 
                affect both sides. Parkinson's signs and symptoms may include (Tremor. A tremor, or shaking, usually begins in a limb, 
                often your hand or fingers. You may rub your thumb and forefinger back and forth, known as a pill-rolling tremor. Your
                hand may tremble when it's at rest. Slowed movement (bradykinesia). Over time, Parkinson's disease may slow your movement,
                making simple tasks difficult and time-consuming. Your steps may become shorter when you walk. It may be difficult to get
                out of a chair. You may drag your feet as you try to walk. Rigid muscles. Muscle stiffness may occur in any part of your 
                body. The stiff muscles can be painful and limit your range of motion. Impaired posture and balance. Your posture may 
                become stooped, or you may have balance problems as a result of Parkinson's disease. Loss of automatic movements. You
                may have a decreased ability to perform unconscious movements, including blinking, smiling or swinging your arms when 
                you walk. Speech changes. You may speak softly, quickly, slur or hesitate before talking. Your speech may be more of a 
                monotone rather than have the usual inflections. Writing changes. It may become hard to write, and your writing may 
                appear small.)

                <p>Parkinson's disease can't be cured, but medications can help control your symptoms, often dramatically. In some more 
                advanced cases, surgery may be advised. Your doctor may also recommend lifestyle changes, especially ongoing aerobic 
                exercise. In some cases, physical therapy that focuses on balance and stretching also is important. A speech-language 
                pathologist may help improve your speech problems.
