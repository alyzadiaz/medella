## Introduction
<p align="justify">
As many of us know, the Healthcare Industry is rapidly growing and many new advancements in technology are needed to help aid with the growth. With new discoveries and research, it is hard for doctors, nurses and patients to get the information they need fast and effectively. Our goal is to help ease the stress of Doctors and Nurses, by creating an application that helps inform patients about their diagnosis, treatments, and self-care. Doctors and Nurses do not have enough time to spend with patients who have been diagnosed with a new disease or illness, which results in more patients getting rehospitalized.
